    <h1><em>Grilled Spaghetti</em></h1>
    <img src="./Grilled-Spaghetti.jpg">
    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Grilled spaghetti is cooked directly in a very simple sauce, so that all the extra flavor from toasting dry pasta on a grill stays in the sauce.</p>
    <p>This is delicious on its own as a side dish, or as a base for other grilled things like eggplant or chicken.</p>
   
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds thick dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>12 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>8 rounded tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>15 cups chicken broth, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons salt, or to taste, depending on salt level of broth</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano or to taste</li>
        <li>4 pinches red chili flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare an outdoor charcoal grill for <strong>medium-high heat.</strong></li>
        <li>Place dry spaghetti on the hot charcoal grill, and cook, tossing often with tongs until the pasta is toasted to a light brown, about <strong>4 minutes</strong>.Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to a pan, and set over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, <strong>30 seconds to 1 minute.</strong> Add tomato paste and <em>sauté</em> for about 1 minute; pour in broth.</li>
        <li>Raise heat to <strong> medium-high</strong> and bring broth to a simmer. Add salt and grilled spaghetti, and use tongs to move spaghetti back and forth until it softens enough to be covered by the broth.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring, until spaghetti is as tender as you like; it will take a few minutes longer than package directions indicate. <em><strong>If pan gets too dry</strong></em>, add another splash of broth.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in butter and basil. Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
